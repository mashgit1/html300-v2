        <p>Coffee in America is about convenience, accessibility, and speed. You will typically find Americans drinking coffee at home or grabbing a cup quickly before heading into the office to begin their workday. Although the craft coffee culture has very much taken off in America, even those craft cocktails are often taken to go.</p>
        <p>This is beginning to change with the third wave of coffee. See more about the three waves of coffee below.</p>

The coffee has specific flavor notes (eg. honey sweetness, rose aromatics, and orange acidity), lighter roast profiles, latte art, single origin beans, and more.
