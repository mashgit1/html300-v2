        <h2>Site Description</h2>
        <p>As an avid coffee drinker, I'm always looking for innovative ways and opportunities where coffee is put to new use. While coffee may be a necessity for many, I want to explore the fun ways that coffee can be found. In many cultures, it is a focal point of connection and social gatherings with cafes and coffee shops being open all throughout the day and night. Its use in American society takes a slightly different route with coffee initially just being seen as being a necessity for providing caffeine to a working individual. With the third and second wave of coffee culture a more exploratory approach is obvious with a focus on high quality beans and flavors.</p>
        <p>My site will explore coffee history and culture to provide this as a resource for others interested and are looking to learn more. It will include the below pages: </p>
          <div class="image-container">
          <img src="images/coffee-beans-top-view-background.jpg" alt="coffee beans">
              <ul>
              <li>History of coffee in the US</li>
              <li>Comparison of coffee culture here and in other areas</li>
              <li>Types of coffee drinks found</li>
              <li>Coffee shop options</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p> The site will have features that allows for comparison of coffee drinks, a feature that will present which drink best fits the users needs, and a map pulling coffee shops. The map pulling coffee shop options will be using Google Maps API and will be embedded in the site. I'm hoping that by building this site I will be able to provide a place for new coffee lovers or long time coffee drinkers to find new ways and coffee options available. WA state in particular has a large coffee culture that can be overwhelming to a new user. This site will make it easier to learn all about coffee and will help direct users to a new drink they can try at a local coffee shop.</p>
