            <h2>United States</h2>
            <p>Coffee in America is about convenience, accessibility, and speed. You will typically find Americans drinking coffee at home or grabbing a cup quickly before heading into the office to begin their workday. Although the craft coffee culture has very much taken off in America, even those craft cocktails are often taken to go.</p>
            <p>This is begining to change with the third wave of coffee.</p>

            <p>In most other parts of the world, coffee culture stems from connection. People gather in groups or at home to socialize with friends and family over a cup of coffee. Coffee culture around the world thrives on connection and it can be seen in cafes in Italy, Turkey, Egypt, Japan, and many other regions.</p>
