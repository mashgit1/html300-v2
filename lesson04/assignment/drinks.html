                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drip Coffee:</strong> Ground coffee is added to a brew basket and placed in an automatic coffee machine for this brewing style. Gravity is used to pass water through the grounds, resulting in a traditional cup of coffee.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pour Over:</strong> This brewing style is achieved by pouring boiling water slowly through coffee grounds as they sit in a filter basket. The coffee then drips into a single cup, resulting in a potent brew.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold Brew:</strong> For cold brew, coarsely ground coffee is placed in room temperature water and allowed to steep for an extended period of time. This results in a less bitter, highly caffeinated brew.</li>
                    <li><strong>Espresso:</strong> Espresso requires a espresso machine which will pass pressurized hot water through a filter containing dark roasted finely ground coffee beans. The force of the water produces a highly concentrated coffee shot. This is the method most commonly used for the base of coffee drinks.</li>
