            <h2>Discovery of Coffee</h2>
            <p>Legend says that coffee was first discoved by an Ethiopian goat herder after he noticed that his goats were strangley energized after eating berries from a tree. They then took the berries and made a drink realizing that it kept them up at night. By the 15th century, coffee had spread and cemented itself as a staple in the Arabian Peninsula with it being grown in Yemen, Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.</p>
            <p>That was the start of coffee houses, this new culture originating from the Arab world, where intellectuals and others would gather, listen to music, read, and engage in lively discussions.</p>

            <p>Coffee became a staple in American culture especially during the Industrial Revolution which is when the first wave of coffee can be seen. The last few decades have been a period of growth and evolution for the global coffee industry. </p>
            </div>
            <h3>First Wave</h3>
            <p>The first wave of coffee is seen as the lowest quality and is known as commodity coffee. The beans are artificially or naturally flavored, primarily pre-ground offerings, and the coffee is dark and bitter.</p>
            <h3>Second Wave</h3>
            <p>The second wave is largely focused on the experience and can be seen in brands like Starbucks and Caribou Coffee that revolutionized cafe culture in the United States in the late 1900s which introduced coffee lovers to a wider variety of coffee experiences.</p>
            <h3>Third Wave</h3>
            <p>Third wave coffee, commonly known as specialty coffee, evolved from a small community in the 1980s that was highly focused on the coffee beans. The coffee has specific flavor notes (eg. honey sweetness, rose aromatics, and orange acidity), lighter roast profiles, latte art, single origin beans, and more. This wave in now the largest coffee sub-industry in the US.
