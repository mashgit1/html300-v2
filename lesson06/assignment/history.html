                <p>By the 15th century, coffee had spread and cemented itself as a staple in the Arabian Peninsula with it being grown in Yemen, Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. That was the start of coffee houses, this new culture originating from the Arab world, where intellectuals and others would gather, listen to music, read, and engage in lively discussions.</p>

            <h2>Coffee Travels to Europe</h2>
            <p>By the 17th century, through trade coffee finally made its way to Europe with many fearing this new dark beverage that had come from the East. Through this controversy, the Pope intervened and after finally tasting it, its popularity finally spread. Coffee began to replace many other drinks such as alcohol in the mornings, due to its ability to allow the drinker to be energized and alert throughout the day.</p>
            <h2>Coffee In the US</h2>
            <p>In the mid 1600s, coffee was brought to New York and although many coffee houses started to appear, tea was still superior among the British. After events of the Boston Tea Party, coffee was forever stamped in American culture.</p>
